Implements SparseMatrix class for efficient storage and operations on large matricies with a high propotion of zero-values. 

Supports numpy.array as input matrix and will generate either a CSR or a CSC representation of the matrix. Supports matrix multiplication and matrix addition. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix for mathematical background.
